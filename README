"Find The Dot" program with Realtime PRU sister program for the Beagle Bone Green

This program uses shared memory between the main CPU and the PRU to coordinate RGB LED illumination, and Joystick detection

Written in majority by me, referencing course material from Brian Frasers CMPT433 Class

At initialization, the BBG will select a "point", represented by an Accelerometer Vector and set that as the goal

The user will then orient the BBG, until the accelerometer Vector is "very close" to the goal vector

The user will then actuate the joystick, to take a "shot" on goal and try and "hit" the "point"

To guide the user, the BBG will change the color and RGB LED illumination on its NeoPixel RGB strip that has been
wired in for the purpose of this program by me using GPIO

This program is threaded, and uses Atomics and shared memory for inter process communication
